## 🔍 Highlights

### Data Overview
- 920 patient records, 16 clinical features
- Features include: age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, thalassemia test, etc.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Age distribution histogram
- Heart disease frequency by sex
- Cholesterol vs Age scatterplot
- Heart disease frequency by chest pain type
- Correlation heatmap of clinical features  

### Insights Summary
- Higher prevalence of heart disease in males compared to females  
- Chest pain type strongly associated with diagnosis outcome  
- Certain thalassemia test results show higher correlation with positive diagnosis

## Next Steps
- Implement machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall  
- Deploy as a simple web app (e.g., Streamlit)
